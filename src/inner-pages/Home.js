                  It is an established culture of our beloved KVBOA to call the
                  spade as spade and the crow as te crow. Despite of all practical difficulties our
                  organization had successfully conducted 'NAMEAND SHAME' at Madurai $ Virudhunagar on 
                  5th August 2018 to highlight the efforts in the recovery front.
                  It is the first time in the history of our KVBOA.

                  <p>
                  It was in 1965 a few officers of  KARUR VYSYA BANK thought it  necessary to form an Association for the officers not with a view to confront the management but with a desire to have a better rapport with the management and redress the grievances of the officers with mutual understanding.
                  During the period prior to 1965, there was no Association for bank officers worth mentioning in the country. It was in this background the KARUR VYSYA BANK OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION was born on 11-4-1965. The first inaugural General Body was held at TELC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, TRICHY, TAMILNADU, About 45 members, representing majority of the officers strength have attended the meeting and showed their solidarity for a common cause.

                  </p>
                  <h5>GENERAL SECRETARY MESSAGE</h5>
                  <p>
                    The Association was registered as a Trade union under the act during September 1966.  It is to the credit of the founder leaders that the Association for bank officers of KVB, was first of its kind in India to be followed by the officers Association of the one of the biggest banks in India. Since then the office bearers who were elected year after year dedicated themselves for the cause of the trade union movement of officer in general and officers of KVB in particular.
                Ever since the formation of the Association various important issues concerning the officers of the bank have been settled, by negotiations across the table. The first negotiated settlement of wage revision was reached on 4-12-68 under the able leadership of Late 
                K.R. Ramasubramaniam. Since then various wage revisions and settlements were reached across the table. The KVBOA was affiliated to the AICOBOO the then apex body for the All India Bank Officers Organisations in 1975 when AICOBOO was formed.
                Later in the year 1987, the Association got the affiliation with AIBOC which is commanding a majority membership of officers Association of Banks in India. However so far as wage revisions and service conditions were the concerned the KVBOA was all along having a direct negotiation with the Management of the Bank.
                </p>

                <p>Earlier when the Pillai Committee recommendation on uniform wages was implemented in public sector banks, KVB was the first to implement the same with certain modifications. This was the first step towards parity in wage structure of officers of KVB. When AIBOC’s maiden country level negotiated wage settlement was reached and implemented in all public sector banks KVB was the first private sector bank to implement the same to its officers with retrospective effect from 1-11-87.
                The KVBOA apart from taking care of the cause of officers of the bank, bestowed its attention to some of the social causes. The Association decided to start a School exclusively for the sake of lower and middle class villagers around Karur.  The Karur Vysya Bank Officers’ Association Educational Trust was thus founded in the year 1992 and the and the KVBOA Matriculation School started functioning without any profit motive.  The members of the KVBOA, both serving and retired, alone are the members of Educational Trust which has duly been registered under TN Societies Registration Act.
                KVBOA has been running the school exclusively from out of the financial support provided by its officers and through the donations received from our well wishers and also from our Bank. Recently the school has received donations of Rs.1.00 each from FEDERAL BANK OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION  and INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION, Rs.2.00 lac from STATE BANK OF INDIA OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION (Chennai Circle). LVB OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION AND INDIAN BANK OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION have also contributed donation to the school. 
                The Association has all officers as upto scale III and some of scale IV as its members and the membership is total. The office bearers of the Association have representation in AIBOC in the State and Central level committees.
                A own building for the Association with spacious guest rooms and meeting hall was constructed at KVB NAGAR, KARUR during 1986.
                The Association has convened its Annual General Meeting every year for the past 46 years and it is celebrated its FORTIETH YEAR celebration during 2005 in various centers. To establish the Association’s Pan India presence, 45th AGM was conducted during 2010 at Mumbai. 
                The Association has able to get Rs. 2.00 lac as loan from the bank to serving officers and also to retired officers for remitting to pension fund on 2nd option on pension. The KVBOA has proudly informed that it is the only Association which is getting Rs.35.00 lac as Housing Loan for its members.
